# Kaldera ZMK Config

Kaldera is based off the Caldera keyboard design by Christian Selig. Using his files
as a foundation, I made Kaldera my own by incorporating unique features and optimizations
and 3D printing custom parts like the case.

Kaldera is a 60-key, split, ortholinear keyboard designed for wireless use with
nice!nano v2-compatible controllers. This repository contains the ZMK firmware
configuration that powers both halves, including the board shield, keymap, and
peripheral feature settings that make the Kaldera layout feel cohesive and portable.

## Keyboard Highlights

- Split ortholinear arrangement with 30 keys per side.
- Runs fully wireless over BLE thanks to a pair of nice!nano v2 clones and
  optimized power settings.
- Layer strategy balances productivity and navigation, using home-row
  modifiers, dedicated media controls, and quick Bluetooth slot switching.
- Designed to be a compact daily driver that still offers full-size coverage
  through multiple layers instead of extra rows.
